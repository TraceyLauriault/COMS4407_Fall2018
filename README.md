# Course Description
> The course will teach students to think critically about data and their assemblages. Emphasis will be on the sociotechnical and political implications of data via a number of contemporary issues. Students will learn that they are data subjects and datafied, they have a data double, leave behind data shadows, statistical agencies try to re-create them as a data person, data socially shape them, they may be domesticated by data, that they may be governed by a dataism ideology and that they may be in the midst of a data revolution.

> In this course, students will define what data are, examine the power of data, and explore how data are used, who owns them, and once data are linked, filtered through algorithms, search engines or visualized into maps and infographics, students will assess if these determine actions and material outcomes.  Students will learn to conceptualize data technically, philosophically, ethically, in the political economy, institutionally and in time and space. In short, students will learn how to think critically about data. 


# Course Objectives
* Distinguish big data from small data, and recognize different types of data;
* Conceptualize data as part of socio-technological and political processes, as a form of discourse and as media;
* Identify data politics and critically read data policies; and
* Think about data-based knowledge, the construction of facts and the framing of the truth.

## Week 1 (Sept.6) - Introduction

Welcome to the class! We will get to know each other, go over the course outline, assessment, learning objectives and do an in-class database reading exercise. Students will learn to differentiate data, datasets, databases and metadata and discuss the production of knowledge and facts, and why we count things in the first place?

#### In Class Datasets for Discussion:

* [Anti-Eviction Mapping Project](https://www.antievictionmap.com/)
* [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/about.html)
* [How Airbnb hid the facts in New York City](http://insideairbnb.com/how-airbnb-hid-the-facts-in-nyc/)
* [Atlas of the Risk of Homelessness](http://legacy.gcrc.carleton.ca/homelessness/intro/intro.xml.html)

#### In Class Data Search Exercise:
* [Open Government Portal](https://open.canada.ca/data) 
* [Statistics Canada 2016 Census](http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/index-eng)
* [ODESI](https://search2.odesi.ca/)

#### In Class Indicator Exercise:

* [Calgary Homeless Foundation Key Performance Indicators](http://calgaryhomeless.com/content/uploads/2017-09-08-KPI-Performance-Goals-Update-v2.pdf) 

#### Assignment 1 - Data Description (Due @ noon Sept. 13) (10%) 3 pages: 

> Look for any dataset related to housing, shelter or homelessness from anywhere, and if possible download those data. Take into consideration the in-class dataset exercise and describe the dataset, where you found it, the steps you took to download it, formats, licences etc. You are also asked to write a brief report about this dataset. The following is a list of ideas to help you do so, but do not limit yourselves to these: Who produced these data and for what purpose? How are the variables defined? Dates? Geographic extent? What are the methodological strengths and limitations of this dataset? What is not being measured? Could these data be used to inform public policy? Is there a fee to access these data? What rights do you have to use these data? If you were to use them would you include any cautionary notes? Do you trust these data and if so why? Find a news article that refers to these data and consider whether the article accurately reported the issue. This is descriptive precise writing, this is not an essay, it is a report.

#### Assignment 2 – Follow Your Personal Data Trail (Due Week 11 @ noon Nov. 22), (5%) 2 pages:

> Part 1: Order your credit score either from TransUnion, Equifax or your bank or request to see the data collected about you from any one of the loyalty services you use such as AirMiles, Shoppers Optimum, Aveda points, etc. 

> Part 2: In 2 pages, discuss the process of ordering these data, the policies related to the protection of these data, are they sold to any third parties, and without disclosing any personal information report some of the things you discovered. 


## Week 2 (Sept. 13) – Conceptualizing data

This week, students sharpen their critical abilities to read and conceptually frame a dataset.  Students will learn about framing data, methodological approaches to the study of data and define critical data studies.  In-class students will examine two reports which frame a particular kind of data discourse and a data intake system based on a conceptualization of data.

#### Readings:

* Chapter 1, [_The Data Revolution_](http://catalogue.library.carleton.ca/record=b3683612) (26 pages).

* Government of Canada (2018) [Canada’s National Housing Strategy](https://www.placetocallhome.ca/pdfs/Canada-National-Housing-Strategy.pdf)

* [Homeless Individuals and Families Information System (HIFIS)](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/communities/homelessness/nhis/hifis.html)


## Week 3 (Sept. 20) – Indicators, Control Rooms and Dashboards

This week students will learn about indicators, data dashboards and control rooms. We will discuss the role of comparative indicators as a form of legitimizing discourse and we will dive deeply into three indicator systems.  In class we will examine dashboard examples and learn about the different kinds of dashboards.  Several resources are provided to inform your dashboard report for the City of Ottawa.

#### Assignment 3 - Indicators (Due Week 7 @ noon Oct. 18) (15%) 5 pages: 

Choose any city, housing or homelessness data or your choice. It can be from any country, at any scale, from a trans-national organization such as the OECD, the World Bank or the UN, Etc. Your job will be to evaluate these data according to the [Open Data Index definition and scoring methodology](http://index.okfn.org/methodology/). The Open Knowledge Foundation evaluates 15 dataset types according to 11 criteria. 

Read the methodological guide carefully. If you go to the [Download Page](http://index.okfn.org/download/), you will find useful CSV files to help you, especially the Datasets.csv and the Questions.csv files.  

Be sure to explore the Index’s website to see how different Places are reported, The Dataset Overview and read the Insights.  Report your assessment in a table, describe the overall results and how you came to conclude the openness of your dataset. Finally, critically discuss the Index as a system. Does the Index assess any housing data? If you were to recommend a housing dataset for the Index to evaluate what would it be and why? Remember to consider international comparability, and challenges. What do you think about this way of evaluating and reviewing data, the nature of the question, how data are framed, is this process objective and fair? What would you improve? What was missing? 


## Week 4 (Sept. 27) – Open Data, Transparency, Accountability & Participation + City of Ottawa Guest Speakers

This week students will learn about open data and related concepts such as transparency accountability and public participation. We will discuss several global initiatives that have informed how the Government of Canada Operates when it comes to open data and see how that translates to the City of Ottawa Open Data Initiative. 

The City of Ottawa Housing and Homelessness Team will be joining us to discuss their housing and homelessness data work and they will share their open data and dashboard requirements.

#### Assignment 4, City of Ottawa, Community & Social Services Department Dashboard Recommendation Report (5-10 pages) (Due Week 13 @ noon Dec. 6) (40%):

> The City of Ottawa Housing and Homelessness Team seeks dashboard expertise from you. The City has adopted an open data and open government policy and this team would like to publish a housing and homelessness public facing dashboard. Today you will meet the City of Ottawa Team, they are your clients, and you will need to listen to them attentively and as the consultant you will be able to ask them questions about why they need a dashboard, what their concerns are, the kinds of constraints they might have, and you can get requirements. You may also ask for additional reference material. Your job is to assess what your client wants, what they need, and what the public should have.

> In this course outline there are relevant reports, indicators, websites, and data portals on the topic of homelessness and last week we examined dashboards. In the library you will find a data visualization display on the first floor with reference books on data visualization where you can explore data communication and visualization techniques and methods. A dashboard is a way to tell the story of a domain on a screen in an interactive way with the use of tables, charts, diagrams, maps, icons and lines, colours, polygons and text etc. Keep in mind that data and indicators require sources, definitions, dates, geographic extent, an author and some sort of statement of quality.

> You will have to decide what indicators you think should be made public, how these should be made public and be communicated, what should not be in a dashboard and why, and design a dashboard landing page. 

> You will write a **formal report** that is a cross between a technical, recommendation, comparative and research report. A **formal report** is a very specific business writing style and format. In the library you will find some business writing guides and in these you will find templates and instructions on formal report writing. Design the structure of your report accordingly.

#### Part 1: Prototype Sketch (Due Week 5 @ noon Oct.4) (5%):

> Sketch by hand or digitally what you think the key components of your dashboard might be. Include a landing page, some navigation instructions, and maybe a flow, network or tree diagram to illustrate how themes, data and indicators are related. This is a prototype it need not be pretty. You can take a picture of your sketch and embed it in a document. 

#### Part 2: DRAFT table of Contents, with list of figures and tables, list the indicators and data you will include in your dashboard, and references (Due Week 6 @ end of class Oct.11) (5%):

> The week 6 class is set aside for you to work in class or go to the library and use the reference materials. In this draft, also include techniques to represent your data and indicators and the justification for doing so. Be sure to include all the components of a formal report as discussed in the reference guides and point to any techniques you find useful from the data visualization material. It is perfectly acceptable to take a picture or a scan of an item in a book (reference it of course) and include it as an example.

#### Part 3: Draft Report for Peer Review (Due Week 10 @ noon Nov. 15) (5%):

> This week you submit a draft of your report, a classmate will be assigned to review your report according to a checklist and they will have one week to send this to you. The marks are for the reviewer.

#### Part 4: Submit your final report (Due Week 13 @ noon Dec. 6) (15%):

> Submit your final report. Also email to the City of Ottawa and cc Tracey. Contact information to follow.

#### Part 5: Presentation to City of Ottawa Staff (Date TBD) (10%):

> You can use Power Point, Sway, or Keynote. It should follow the same structure as your report and it should be no more than 6 minutes long.


## Week 5 (Oct. 4) – The Characteristics of Big Data

This week students will learn what constitutes big data, and how to define and distinguish big data from small data. In addition, students will study the nature of big data, the characteristics of survey data, administrative data and big data and unpack the ontological traits of several datasets. We will also discuss the role of experts, think tanks, and consulting firms in the shaping of big data discourse with an in-class led critical reading of 2 big data reports. We will also discuss the material effects of a big data-based sharing economy platform.

## Week 7 (Oct 18) - Enablers and Rationale for Big Data

This week students will learn to think historically by examining the enablers of big data. We will do a high-level genealogy of the technologies associated with the emergence of big data especially networks, systems, devices and sensors, social media and a variety of methods to collect data. By doing so students will learn that data and technological ‘revolutions’ do not come from no-where, they are evolutionary, and they are socio-technological artefacts. In-class we will examine how the state of Massachusetts strategically positioned itself as the big data centre of power in the US, by studying 2 key reports 1 spearheaded by the Governor’s Office and the other by an industry association. We will also look at how Europe is developing a common data strategy, how the enabling effects of big data and big tech has benefits and pitfalls and look at Canadian R&D and its enabling effects.

## Week 11 (Nov. 22) – Data Brokers

Big data are alive and well in media industries and data brokerage firms.  This week we will examine the political economy of data by examining types of data services, data products, laws, oversight, regulation and associated issues such as privacy, the corporate use of open data for private sector gain, how data get bundled up and re-sold and how data about you and I get bought and sold and in the hands of corporations with whom we have no relationship. We will also discuss your personal data trail.
